(1) INTRODUCTION.

This article is the first one of a series showing how to implement an application conforming to Ports and Adapters pattern, also known as Hexagonal Architecture.

This series has a practical sense. It is supposed that the reader already has theorical knowledge about concepts regarding hexagonal architecture, like actors, ports, adapters, etc. Otherwise, in the Links section you can find resources to read about it.

In this chapter, we will see a process for designing the application, explaining how to find out the different elements of the architecture for the application we want to build.

First of all, I describe the application that will be used as an example along this series. And finally, as a bonus track, I will show an outline of the paralelism between hexagonal architecture and use cases.
